# Air Quality Index (AQI) Data Collector and ML Model Training
This project focuses on collecting Air Auality Index data from [here](https://aqicn.org/city/nigeria/abuja/us-embassy/) and adding it to `data/aqi_data.csv` file to build a dataset for model training to determine the air quality in Nigeria.
This project is solely focused on Abuja as it is the only place in Nigeria with a working AQI monitor.
